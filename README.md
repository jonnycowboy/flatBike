OpenHW Plywood Motorcycle - CC-BY-SA

Original inspiration from Jack's Tinker motorcyle:

I was dissapointed in three aspects of this motorcycle: 
- despite being called open source, the files are not available anywhere?
- despite the design calling for re-use of accidented motorcycles, the front suspension which is one of the most easily damagable parts is reused.  I have replaced mine by a cuttable Hossack front end. (will be re-designed with dimensions from Tony Foale's excellent "FFE analysis" software).
- although I understand the use of aluminum, this makes the project quite cost-prohibitive.  For now I'll be using two sheets of sandwiched 3/4" outdoor grade plywood per side.  The goal would be to able to cut it out of two sheets of 4'x8' (about 80$CDN) so that I could use something like Printrbot's "crawlbot" to cut it out. In the future I will likely go back to aluminum once the design is good.  

The initial file checkin is just a mockup, once I pull out my motorcycle chassis design books and measure a few different engines it will likely change quite a bit.  

Hit me up if you have comments!  I hope most of the discussion for this project be done via the MC-CHASSIS-DESIGN mailing list.
